<h2>Super AI: Intelligent Desing for IQ 140 People</h2>

<p>The first article makes the point of AI as a kind of as a kind of cognitive orthoses. that means a a technological system that extends human cognition. The new approach of AI research does not intend to imitate human behaviour but to extend and amplify and provide functional substitues for existing human behaviour.</p>

<p>The author of the second article introduces us to the concept of super AI. He defines super AI as intelligence that has surpased the capabilities of human intelligence. Once super AI is achieved it will solve all our problems. Cure Cancer, defy death and thus help the species to reach immortality. He further argues that we are really close to super AI. According to him, increased computational power is all that is needed to achieve said goal.
He introduces us to the different groups of AI reserachers with different expectations on what AI will mean to us and how fast we will achieve it. Further more he talks about the two different outcomes that super AI might have on our society and species.</p>


<p>In my opinion Intelligence is not binary. Eg you either are intelligent or you are not. Its a gradient between purely instinct and reflex driven behaviour and high level abstract thinking. I find that central for higher (Human level) intelligence is an abstract problem solving process. Applying past experiences and knowledge to new situations. But also being able to understand new situations without having prior experience. I think theres more to intelligence then pure processing power. It might aswell be that all we need to stop aging or to cure cancer but it could also be that it is just physically impossible to achieve</p> 

<p>What i like most about the article is ironically a point that the author mentions but disagrees with strongly. “AI, Intelligent Design for IQ 140 People” or “The nurds rapture". Intelligent people that deny the existence of god and and eternal afterlife still need some form of comfort to deal with their mortality. Thus they turn to super AI which will help them escape death.</p>
