  <h2>Super AI: Intelligent Desing for IQ 140 People</h2>

  <br>
  
  <p>I find that the <first article> gives an overview of the current state of AI without falling into wishful thinking. </p>

  <p>The <second article>  tries to give an overview but more often then not makes heavy assumptions about the effects of super AI on society</p>

  <p>In my opinion Intelligence is not binary. Eg you either are intelligent or you are not. Its a gradient between purely instinct and reflex driven behaviour and high level abstract thinking. I find that central for higher (Human level) intelligence. Is an abstract problem solving process. Applying past experiences and knowledge to new situations. But also being able to understand </p>
